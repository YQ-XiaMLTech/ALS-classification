# **ALS Classification: Multi-Class Classification for ALS Diagnosis**  

This project focuses on a **multi-class classification task** to differentiate between:  
- **Control group** (healthy individuals)  
- **ALS Concordant** (patients diagnosed with ALS, exhibiting cognitive impairment)  
- **ALS Discordant** (patients diagnosed with ALS, without cognitive impairment)  

By leveraging deep learning techniques, this study aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of **sporadic ALS** using pathological brain imaging data.

## **Project Overview**  
- **Objective:** Investigate the link between **ALS cognitive impairments** and **TDP-43 protein deposition** using deep learning.  
- **Dataset:** 190 postmortem brain autopsy images from ALS patients and controls.  
- **Methodology:**  
  - Implemented a **CNN-based deep learning framework**.  
  - Integrated **squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention mechanism** to enhance feature representation.  
  - Applied **transfer learning** for improved generalization on a limited dataset.  
- **Results:** Achieved **91% classification accuracy**, distinguishing ALS subtypes with high precision.  
- **Current Status:** The study has been **submitted to Scientific Reports**.
